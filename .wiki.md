Project Summary
The project is a web application named AgriCare that utilizes machine learning to help farmers identify crop diseases. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of their crops, and the application will analyze the images to predict potential diseases, providing insights and recommendations based on the analysis. The application integrates Google and GitHub OAuth for user authentication and employs a database to manage user accounts and their data.

Project Module Description
User Authentication: Handles user registration, login, and session management using OAuth.
Disease Prediction: Uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze crop images and predict diseases.
Email Notifications: Sends email notifications for user interactions such as sign-up confirmations and contact form submissions.
File Upload: Allows users to upload images for disease analysis.
Admin Dashboard: Provides features for managing user accounts and viewing analytics.
