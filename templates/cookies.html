          <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
          <p>
            AgriCare uses several types of cookies for different purposes. We
            classify them as follows:
          </p>

          <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function
            properly. They enable core functionality such as security, network
            management, and accessibility. You cannot disable these cookies as
            the website cannot function properly without them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> User authentication, maintaining user
            session state, preventing fraudulent use of login credentials.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics/Performance Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our
            website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. This
            data helps us improve how our website works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Counting visits and traffic sources,
            measuring which pages are most popular, understanding how visitors
            move around the site.
          </p>

          <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality
            and personalization based on your preferences and past activity.
            They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we
            have added to our pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Remembering your language preference,
            region selection, or username for future visits.
          </p>

          <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to track visitors across websites to display
            relevant advertisements. They are also used to limit the number of
            times you see an ad and measure the effectiveness of advertising
            campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies placed by advertising networks to
            collect information about your browsing habits and interests.
          </p>

          <h3>Social Media Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are set by social media services that we have added to
            our site to enable you to share our content with your friends and
            networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other
            sites and building a profile of your interests.

            websites that you do not want to be tracked. Our website does not
            currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals, as there is no industry
            standard for implementation.
